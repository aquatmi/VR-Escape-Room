# VR Escape Room

Module: Virtual Reality

Brief: Produce a Virtual Reality Experience

Engine: Unreal Engine 4

Grade: 1st

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
What I did: 

Produced an escape room in Unreal Engine 4.

Provided ability to interact with most objects within the room, excluding tables/shelves etc.

User has to find 3 fuses in the room, to provide power to the door to unlock it and escape.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
What I would like to add post-marking

My own artwork and models.

More ways to obtain fuses, so that a random 3 could be selected on start.

Other levels/rooms
